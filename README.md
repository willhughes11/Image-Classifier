# Image-Classifier
Udacity AI Programming with Python Capstone Project

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

Load and preprocess the image dataset
Train the image classifier on your dataset
Use the trained classifier to predict image content
