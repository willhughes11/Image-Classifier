# Image-Classifier
Udacity AI Programming with Python Capstone Project

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. The model can be trained and tested in the notebook or on a server in command line by running the train.py and predict.py scripts.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

* Load and preprocess the image dataset
* Train the image classifier on your dataset
* Use the trained classifier to predict image content
